# Fundamental project for QA

## Objective 
### Overall objective with this project is the following:

> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
> methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
> covered during training.

### Specific Requirements
* Application must have CRUD functionality
* Apllication mustbe created in Python
* Fully designed test suites for the application
* A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

## Initial Ideas

* Recipes to ingredients - Simple and effective but want to do something a bit different
* Car makes to models - Will be interesting but might get dull
* Game studioes to games - A lot of information and constant updating 
* Chocolate company to chocolate - Simple but relatively dull

## Proposal

I have decided to create a site where the users are able to see the top 10 video games from certain Video Game Design studio's based on ratings.

Create - Profiles of games and Video Game Studio's:
* Title
* Release Date/Creation Date
* Description
* Rating (IGN)

Read
* Video Game Studio's
* Video Games

Update
* New games come out
* New Studio's are created

Delete:
* If a game drops out of the top 10 then the information will be deleted.
